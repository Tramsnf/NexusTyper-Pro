REQUEST: RCA Review Deliverable

Objective
Construct a forensic timeline of the chain-of-command breakdown during the incident window described in the input. Identify divergence points between required actions in the governing protocol and administrative directives and/or operational behavior.

Tasks
1. Protocol variance detection (protocol compliance)
Compare administrative directives and operational outcomes documented in the input against the triggers and mandatory actions in the governing protocol and any attached intake/control procedure(s).

 - Identify two specific instances where a high-severity surge/disaster trigger required immediate suspension of automated intake/acceptance (or an equivalent automation), but documented directives or documented operational behavior indicate the automation remained active or was treated as active.
 - For each instance, cite the relevant policy section number(s) and the supporting source timestamp(s) from the administrative and operational artifacts.
 - For each instance, describe the downstream operational consequence in neutral terms (for example: intake remained open; queueing continued; external routing assumptions remained unchanged).

2. Timeline reconstruction (incident window)
Reconstruct the timeline for the incident window specified in the input. Use the clinical record/log as the primary clinical time anchor, administrative communications as the administrative time anchor, and operational system logs relevant to intake/routing/capacity as corroborating anchors (for example: transfer/dispatch communications, routing-status audits, capacity dashboards, staffing snapshots). Use other sources only for supporting context.
Pinpoint:

 - The first moment front-line clinical staff raised saturation/overcrowding concerns.
 - The first moment the protocol-defined capacity metric exceeded the activation threshold for the highest surge/disaster level.
 - The first documented administrative directive rejecting surge activation and/or any external routing-status authorization (if applicable).
 - The exact time any external routing-status change (for example: diversion/redirect) was authorized and became effective per the relevant audit log (if present).
 - The latest moment the adverse/sentinel event was underway as implied by clinical and administrative entries.

3. Conflict synthesis (critical resource capacity discrepancy)
Analyze discrepancies between critical resource capacity reported by clinical leadership and the capacity cited by administration and/or reflected in system views (for example: ICU/telemetry beds if applicable).
Explain the discrepancy using only context present in the input, including:

 - Staffed/operational capacity vs licensed/physical capacity definitions and timestamps (as defined by the input).
 - Competency constraints limiting redeployment feasibility.
 - Any capacity units (rooms/beds/slots) listed as available in administrative systems while operationally closed/unavailable.
 - Effects of any forced/unsafe placement into a previously closed/unavailable unit on dashboard interpretations.

Deliverable format requirements
Return a structured Markdown document using the following headers exactly (spelling and order must match):

Sentinel Event Timeline

Protocol Violations (Governing Protocol)

Data Discrepancy Analysis (Critical Resource Capacity)

Root Cause Statement

Documentation expectations
- Base the analysis strictly on the discovery package below. Do not introduce external facts.
- When timestamps conflict, explicitly state which source is treated as the anchor for that segment and why.
- When asserting a protocol violation, cite the exact policy section number and quote only the minimum necessary clause (short excerpts).
- Describe capacity and staffing using the provided counts and definitions; do not derive additional metrics beyond the values shown.
- Focus on process failure and chain-of-command deviation.

INPUT DATA

St. Jude Regional Medical Center
Sentinel Event Discovery Package (RCA Support)

Context
A delayed access to definitive care occurred during an internal capacity crisis ("Code Triage") while the region experienced power instability. The review window is 18:00 to 22:00 EST on Nov 14 (local time). Clinical logs and system feeds use 24-hour timestamps. The email archive uses labeled EST times.

Source handling notes
- Identify the governing protocol/policy document(s) and any attached intake/control procedure(s) within the input. Identify which artifacts constitute (a) administrative communications, (b) clinical records/logs, and (c) operational system logs (for example: transfer/dispatch communications, routing-status audits, capacity dashboards, staffing snapshots). Use the dataset’s labels as-is, whatever they are.
- Treat operational artifacts as potentially inconsistent due to role-based visibility and differing system definitions (for example, “licensed” vs “staffed” capacity, if such terms appear).

SOURCE A: Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)
Title: Annex K: Capacity Management and Surge Protocols
Version: 4.1 (Active)
Approved by: Medical Executive Committee

Section 1: Definitions
1.1 NEDOCS Score: Score calculated to assess ED overcrowding. Score > 180 triggers Code Violet (Internal Disaster).
1.2 Divert Status: Formal declaration to EMS to bypass the facility. Only the Incident Commander (IC) or the CEO can authorize Divert.

Section 2: Chain of Command
2.1 Business Hours (07:00-17:00): Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) acts as Incident Commander.
2.2 Off Hours (17:00-07:00): Nursing House Supervisor assumes Functional Command until Administrator On Call (AOC) responds.
2.3 AOC response requirement: AOC must respond within 15 minutes of a Code Violet escalation.

Section 3: Surge Levels and Triggers
3.1 Level 1 (Warning): ED Holds > 5.
Mandatory action: House Supervisor alerts Unit Managers.

3.2 Level 2 (Critical): ED Holds > 10 OR ICU at zero staffed beds.
Mandatory action: AOC notified. Elective surgeries cancelled.

3.3 Level 3 (Disaster / Code Violet)
Trigger: NEDOCS > 180 OR critical infrastructure failure (example: power instability affecting clinical operations).
Mandatory action: Auto-Accept protocol is suspended (Transfer Center intake controls).
Mandatory action: Reverse Triage protocol is activated (discharge stable patients immediately).
Mandatory action: If ICU is full, PACU must act as overflow ICU.

Section 4: Exceptions
4.1 Protected Code Blue: Patients in cardiac arrest on hospital grounds must be accepted regardless of diversion status.
4.2 Fiscal Override: CFO approval required for any diversion lasting longer than 4 hours due to revenue impact.

SOURCE A-APPENDIX: Transfer Center Intake Controls (Local Procedure Attachment)
Attachment label: Annex K Appendix TC-1 (Transfer Center Intake Controls)
Revision: TC-1.6
Owner: Transfer Center Manager
Effective: Current at time of incident

TC-1 Definitions
TC-1.1 Auto-Accept (default ON): Inbound transfer requests meeting predefined clinical criteria are accepted without Incident Commander approval.
TC-1.2 Auto-Accept Suspended (required at Level 3): All inbound transfer requests require Incident Commander approval prior to acceptance and bed assignment.
TC-1.3 Suspension trigger: Any Level 3 / Code Violet condition per Annex K 3.3 requires immediate Auto-Accept suspension and a Transfer Center notification to the House Supervisor and AOC.
TC-1.4 Documentation rule: Transfer Center logs must record Auto-Accept state changes and the approving authority (role and timestamp).
